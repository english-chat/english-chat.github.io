Prescriptivism per-se is discouraged, though it's OK to note when grammar or
word-choice is sufficiently unusual to be confusing. Feel free to nit-pick in
detail when someone specifically asks for stronger constructive criticism.

English has many dialects;
* some have tens of millions of speakers, some have only thousands;
* some are written in rich countries, some are spoken in poor countries;
* some are proclaimed by elites, and some are whispered by the powerless.

No particular dialect is "the only proper way to speak or write English".
In particular, _your_ dialect isn't the only "right" one.

There are, however, some basic writing standards that people participating in
discussions in ##English are expected to adhere to. Notably the use of "u"
(you) "r" (are) "4" (for) and other such common internet short-hands are to be
avoided. This channel caters to English speakers of various skill levels and
learners should not be subjected to such errors. If you are corrected for
using poor grammar or punctuation please do not be offended and make an effort
to adhere to the advice. It may be considered rude if you continue to make the
same mistake without any apparent effort to correct yourself and action may be
taken.
