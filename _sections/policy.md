Like all channels on Libera.Chat, ##English is governed by
[Libera.Chat's guidelines](https://libera.chat/guidelines/), which takes
precedence over anything said here.

Please avoid:
- ad-hominem attacks;
- racism, sexism, homophobia, religious intolerance, or other -isms
and -phobias that exclude or demean people based on characteristics that they
cannot choose;
  - take care to avoid using group-labels when intending to critize
  someone _else_ -- consider how you would feel if the label applied to _you_.
- intentionally inflammatory remarks.

There is a general rule that private messages should not be sent unless you
have permission to do so. The primary reason is that private messages are
demanding; answering costs time, but not answering snubs the sender.
Sometimes both are unacceptable, so it's rude to force the recipient to make
the choice. See the [longer explanation](/privatemessaging).
