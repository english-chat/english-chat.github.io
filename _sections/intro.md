This channel is for questions and discussions about English as a language, at
all levels of skill.

In particular, learners of English are welcome, though this isn't a general
"practice" channel.

Please configure your IRC client to use UTF-8 encoding, and please at least
_try_ to use standard spelling and grammar.
