These are some of the topics that are commonly discussed in the channel:

- Prepositions - the bane of most second-language learners.
- Improving the wording of specific phrases.
- Explaining subtle differences between similar terms & phrases.
- Comparison of modern English grammar and lexicon with other languages.
- Comparison between current dialects of modern English.
- Evolution of the language over time.

We are reasonably tolerant of off-topic discussions, as long as they don't
obscure on-topic questions. But if your discussion becomes highly specialized
or wildly off-topic, please consider switching to
[##English-offtopic](irc://irc.libera.chat/%23%23English-offtopic), or a
channel designated for the topic, or private messages.
