Be an enabler, not an obstruction.

Try to answer at a level suitable for the questioner. If you find yourself
becoming frustrated, consider leaving space for others to answer instead.

Be aware that people often cannot read incoming messages at the same time as
they're composing an outgoing message; allow for delays of up to a few
minutes, and do not assume you're being ignored because someone asks something
that you've just answered: perhaps they were still typing their question and
hadn't seen your answer before they sent it.
